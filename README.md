Pointers in C++ are variables that store memory addresses, pointing to the location where a value is stored rather than the value itself. They are powerful tools that enable efficient array and string manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, and the creation of complex data structures like linked lists and trees. By using pointers, programmers can optimize performance and memory usage, as well as create functions that modify their arguments directly. Pointers also allow for the development of flexible and reusable code, making them a fundamental concept in C++ programming.
